# Int-Binary-Tree
This is a simple program that stores integers in an Integer Binary Tree Data Structure
then displays the menu:
  
  	1. Insert Nodes
	2. Delete Nodes
	3. Display Nodes Pre-Order
  	4. Display Nodes In-Order
	5. Display Nodes Post-Order
	6. Count Number of Nodes and Leaf Nodes
	Any other key to Quit
	Enter Choice:

in which the user can choose to which choice he or she would like to perform.

NOTE: This program assumes correct user behavior (i.e., when deleting node, user is expected to delete a node that is
      already inserted in the binary tree).
